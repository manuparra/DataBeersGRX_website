* DataBeersGrx WebSite Generator
This is the *DataBeersGrx* WebSite Generator, an adaptation of [[https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/][GrayScale theme]] migrated to Hugo by [[https://elbauldelprogramador.com/en/][elbauldelprogramador.com]]
* How to build
Install Hugo, and then:
** For testing
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
hugo  server --bind="0.0.0.0" --verboseLog -DFw --i18n-warnings -d /tmp/hugo
#+END_SRC
** For production
Just make your changes and then run =./deploy.sh=
*** TODO
* Create new events
To add a new event:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
hugo new event/my-event-name.md
#+END_SRC

Then you must complete the information for the event in the frontmatter. For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC toml
+++
title =  "My Event Name"
date = 2017-11-21T11:18:15+01:00

[[eventDetails]]
    when = 2017-11-21T11:18:15+01:00
    where = ""
    whereUrl = "" # Url to link to the site
    whereAddrs = "" # Address of the place
    city = ""
    description = ""
    url = "" # Meetup  URL
    start = 2017-11-21T11:18:15+01:00 # Event start
    end = 2017-11-21T11:18:15+01:00 # Event ends
[[eventDetails.speakers]] # List of speakers
    name = ""
    motto = ""
    contact = "" # How to contact the speaker
    contactAnchor = "" # how to display the contact url, example @username
    bio = ""
    image = "" # path to image (Relative to /img/speakers)
+++
#+END_SRC

If you need more speakers, simply add them:

#+BEGIN_SRC toml
[[eventDetails.speakers]] # List of speakers
    name = ""
    motto = ""
    contact = "" # How to contact the speaker
    contactAnchor = "" # how to display the contact url, example @username
    bio = ""
    image = "" # path to image (Relative to /img/speakers)
[[eventDetails.speakers]] # List of speakers
    name = ""
    motto = ""
    contact = "" # How to contact the speaker
    contactAnchor = "" # how to display the contact url, example @username
    bio = ""
    image = "" # path to image (Relative to /img/speakers)
#+END_SRC

If you want to show two speakers as one, because they speak together, set =isMultiple= to =true=:

#+BEGIN_SRC toml
[[eventDetails.speakers]]
    isMultiple = true
    name = ["Speaker1", "Speaker2"]
    motto = ""
    contact = ["https://speaker1.com", "https://speaker2.com/"]
    contactAnchor = ["@speaker1", "@speaker2"]
    bio = ""
    image = ["speaker1.jpg", "speaker2.jpg"] # path to image
#+END_SRC

That's it!
